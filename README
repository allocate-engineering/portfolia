## Project Overview

You will build a single-page application using either Vue, React, or Angular. We've provided starter projects for each framework in the respective folders (`vue`, `react`, `angular`). Your task is to hydrate the application with data from a hosted JSON file, allow users to add new stock buys, and provide a detailed view for each stock buy.

## Requirements

1. **Hydrate Data**: Fetch and display data from the provided JSON file.
2. **Add New Stock Buys**: Implement a form to add new stock buys.
3. **Detail View**: Allow users to click on a stock buy to view more detailed information.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the folder of your chosen framework (`vue`, `react`, or `angular`).
3. Install the dependencies and start the development server.
4. Fetch data from the hosted JSON file and display it in the application.
5. Implement the feature to add new stock buys.
6. Implement click-through on each stock block to show a more detailed view of that stock buy.

## JSON Data

You can fetch the stock buy data from the following link:

[Stock Buys JSON](http://jon.allocate.biz.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stock-buys.json)

## Figma Design

You can find the design for the application in the following Figma file:
